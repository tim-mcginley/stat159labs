##Description

This lab report is a simple remake of the second homework we have been assigned. In that homework, we were asked to perform a simple regression using some basic advertising data.  This lab recreates this assignment in LaTeX and contains all of the same information.  The final report can be found in report/lab9.pdf while the .Rnw file used to create it is in /report/lab9.Rnw.

**Important**: This is a straight remake of the homework assignment so the verbiage still refers to homework and not lab, etc.
